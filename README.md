## Who am I?

I am both a Basketball and Programming enthusiast. Not only do I love watching and playing basketball, I also love to code and go beyond the limits of what other Discord bots might not have. I have been playing Basketball for about 3-4 years now and I absolutely love it. Programming on the other hand, specifically in JavaScript, I've been doing for about a year while I've been doing Discord bot development for over a few months now which I really like doing!

I've also got experience when it comes to interacting with different API's, such as Discord, YouTube, Spotify and SoundCloud. I've also got experience when it comes to setting up different databases such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

I am currently in High School, and my pronouns are **he/him**. Feel free to contact me through any of the social media links I mentioned above! For quickest response, try and reach out to me on Discord! :)

## Where I currently work / What I currently work for

**-> Co-Founder of Storm Developmentz**

I am the Co-Founder of [Storm Developmentz](https://stormdevelopmentz.xyz/home), which is a Discord bots development Team with individuals with a lot of past experience. We focus on providing users and servers with top-quality bots, that are relibable, effecient, and trustworthy. The most unique part about us is that most of the bots and features we develop, cannot be found within public bots. 

**-> Developer for StormBeatz**

I am a Developer for StormBeatz, a highly advanced music bot, that can be highly configured with plenty of commands and settings with about 8500 servers. Sure, it may not be the biggest bot, but it's growing on a daily basis everyday. When using StormBeatz, it will liven up your music to its fullest potential, with commands and features no other music bot has. StormBeatz is also associated with Storm Developmentz, as it is under that Development Team.

**-> BACON ARMY Head Admin / Bot Developer**

I am the Head Admin for BACON ARMY, and also the Community Manager. The Discord server has over 160,000 members and is constantly growing everyday, with the owner being [MyUsernamesThis](https://youtube.com/myusernamesthis). I also manage and code some of the bots in the community. 

**-> Jailbreak Moderator**

I am a Moderator for Jailbreak, a very popular game on Roblox. The Discord server has over 190,000 members, with hundreds of thousands of users playing the game every single day. 

**-> AedusMC Bot Developer**

I am a Bot Developer for AedusMC, an upcoming Minecraft server with a very unique gamemode. Stay tuned for it! 

**-> Plenty more communities!**

## What am I looking to work right now?

Some places I am interested in working at:

- Tim Hortons
