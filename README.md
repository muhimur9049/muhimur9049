## Who am I?

I am both a Basketball and Programming enthusiast. Not only do I love watching and playing basketball, but I also love to code and go beyond the limits of what other Discord bots might not have. I have been playing basketball for about 3-4 years now, and I love it. Programming on the other hand, specifically in JavaScript, I've been doing for around a year while I've been doing Discord bot development for over a few months now, which I like doing!

I've also got experience when it comes to interacting with different APIs, such as Discord, YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, Tidal, and other streaming platforms. I've also got experience when it comes to setting up other databases such as SQLite, MySQL and PostgreSQL.

I am currently in High School, and my pronouns are **he/him**. Feel free to contact me through any of the social media links I mentioned above! For the quickest response, try and reach out to me on Discord! :)

## My current occupations

**-> Co-Founder of Storm Developmentz**

I am the Co-Founder of [Storm Developmentz](https://stormdevelopmentz.xyz/home), a Discord bots development Team with individuals with a lot of experience. We focus on providing users and servers with top-quality bots that are reliable, efficient, and trustworthy. The unique part about us is that you cannot find most of the bots and features we develop within public bots, so we provide unique bot code. 

**-> Developer for StormBeatz**

I am a Developer for StormBeatz, a highly advanced music bot that you can highly configure with plenty of commands and settings with about 10,500+ servers. It supports around 12 different music platforms, which most music bots aren't able to do. Sure, it may not be a giant bot, but it's growing daily every day. Using StormBeatz will liven up your music to its fullest potential, with commands and features no other music bot has. StormBeatz is also associated with Storm Developmentz, as it is under that Development Team.

**-> BACON ARMY Head Admin / Bot Developer**

I am the Head Admin for BACON ARMY and also the Community Manager. The Discord server has over 160,000 members and is constantly growing every day, with the owner being [MyUsernamesThis](https://youtube.com/myusernamesthis). I also manage and code some of the bots in the community. 

**-> Jailbreak Moderator**

I am a Moderator for Jailbreak, a popular game on Roblox. The Discord server has over 190,000 members, with hundreds of thousands of users playing the game every day. 

**-> AedusMC Bot Developer**

I am a Bot Developer for AedusMC, an upcoming Minecraft server with a unique game mode. Stay tuned for it! 

**-> Plenty more communities!**

## Where am I looking to work right now?

I am currently looking for a job to make some money to support myself and the projects I develop. This way, I can grow them even further by advertising them.

Some places I am interested in working at:

- Tim Hortons
- McDonalds
- Baskin Robbins
- DQ 

If you can help me find any work with consistent pay, please reach out and let me know!
